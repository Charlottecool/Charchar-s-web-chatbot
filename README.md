# Charchar's Web Chatbot

A simple web-based chatbot application that allows users to interact with an AI chatbot. The frontend is built with React using Next.js, while the backend is powered by FastAPI. The chatbot connects to OpenAI's API for generating responses.

---

## Features

- Users can type messages in a text input field.
- Messages are sent to the backend, which processes the request and returns a reply from OpenAI's API.
- Replies are displayed in real-time on the web interface.

```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

By default, the backend will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

### **3. Setup the frontend**

Navigate to the `frontend/` folder:
```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## File Details

### **Backend (`main.py`)**
- Handles POST requests at `/chat/`.
- Sends the user's message to OpenAI's API and returns the chatbot's reply.

### **Frontend (`page.tsx`)**
- Contains the React component for the user interface.
- Manages state using `useState` for user messages and chatbot replies.
- Sends API requests to the backend using `fetch`.

---

## Example Interaction

- **User Input**: "Hello, chatbot!"
- **Chatbot Reply**: "Hi there! How can I assist you today?"

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Errors**:
   - Ensure the backend allows requests from `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Check that `CORSMiddleware` is configured in `main.py`.

2. **Backend Not Running**:
   - Make sure you have started the FastAPI server using `uvicorn`.

3. **Frontend Errors**:
   - Check for any errors in the browser console.
   - Verify the backend URL in `fetch` is correct (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/`).
